### Hi there, I'm Elisa 👋

I'm a researcher with a blend of ML/DL and bioinformatics expertise. I just finished my doctoral studies, which revolved around statistical, interpretable ML, and graph representation learning methods to identify blood-based molecular markers in Parkinson's disease diagnosis and prognosis. I'm passionate about applying ML techniques to solve challenges in the biomedical field.

About me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on GNN-based pipelines to model omics data representations
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding omics datasets with case-control samples in the context of neurodegeneration
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about LLMs & pLMs
- 💡 I'm interested in entrepreneurship
- 👩🏻‍💻 I'm a Google Summer of Code '24 contributor at DeepChem.

Drop me a line if you think I can help you!
