### Hi there, I'm Elisa ðŸ‘‹

I'm a researcher with a blend of ML modeling and bioinformatics expertise. I just finished my doctoral studies, which revolved around statistical, interpretable ML, and graph representation learning methods to identify blood-based molecular markers in Parkinson's disease diagnosis and prognosis. I'm passionate about applying ML techniques to solve challenges in the biomedical realm.

About me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on GNN-based pipelines to model omics data
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML/bio projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding omics datasets with case-control samples in the context of neurodegeneration
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about LLMs
- ðŸ’¡ I'm interested in entrepreneurship

Drop me a line if you think I can help you!
